  "userManual": "## Project Name: Code Analysis Tool\n\n### Overview\nThe Code Analysis Tool is a software project designed to analyze code snippets provided by users and determine their nature, purpose, and functionality. The tool can identify various types of code, such as binary data, encrypted content, minified CSS, or corrupted files. Developers can use this tool to gain insights into the content of code snippets and troubleshoot issues related to code readability and integrity.\n\n### Architecture\nThe tool consists of a code analysis engine that processes the input code snippets and generates summaries based on the detected characteristics of the code. The engine includes modules for identifying binary data, encrypted content, minified CSS, and corrupted files. Each module utilizes specific algorithms and patterns to classify and analyze the code snippets accurately.\n\n### How to Use\n1. Input: Developers can provide code snippets in various programming languages or file formats to the tool for analysis.\n2. Analysis: The tool will process the input code snippet and generate a summary report indicating the nature of the code (binary, encrypted, minified, corrupted) and potential issues with readability or integrity.\n3. Interpretation: Developers can review the summary report to understand the characteristics of the code snippet and take appropriate actions based on the analysis results.\n4. Troubleshooting: If the code is identified as binary, encrypted, minified, or corrupted, developers can follow the recommendations provided in the summary to address any issues with the code content.\n\n### Contribution\nDevelopers can contribute to the Code Analysis Tool project by:\n- Adding new code analysis modules for detecting different types of code patterns.\n- Enhancing existing algorithms for improved accuracy in code classification.\n- Providing feedback on the tool's performance and suggesting enhancements for better code analysis capabilities.\n\nFor more information and to contribute to the project, please visit the Code Analysis Tool repository on GitHub.\n\nThank you for using the Code Analysis Tool to analyze code snippets effectively!"
