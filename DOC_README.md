**User Manual for the Repository**

**Overall Purpose:**
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and setup for a React project using Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules. It aims to provide developers with a structured approach to building React applications with efficient development tools and best practices.

**Notable Architecture:**
The repository includes configuration files for Docker Compose, ESLint, and Vite, along with source code files for React components, CSS styling, and HTML structure. The multi-container setup defined in the docker-compose.yaml file orchestrates services for a web application, database, and cache, creating a unified application environment. ESLint rules in eslint.config.js ensure code quality, while Vite and React plugins streamline the development process.

**How to Set Up and Run:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and Docker installed.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the Docker containers using `docker-compose up`.
5. Run the React application with HMR by executing `npm run dev`.
6. Access the application in your browser at the specified port.

**Key Functionalities:**
1. **React Portfolio:** The src/App.jsx file showcases a portfolio with sections for social media links, user information, favorite projects, and a modal for project details. Users can interact with project cards to view more information.
2. **Styling:** CSS files like src/App.css and src/index.css provide custom styling for various elements, creating a visually appealing design for the application.
3. **SVG Icon:** The src/assets/react.svg file defines an icon for the React logo with dynamic visual effects.
4. **Development Tools:** ESLint rules in eslint.config.js ensure code consistency, while Vite and React plugins in vite.config.js enhance the development experience.
5. **Entry Point:** The src/main.jsx file sets up the main entry point for the React application, rendering the App component within a React.StrictMode element.

By following the setup instructions and exploring the key functionalities, developers can leverage this repository to kickstart their React projects efficiently and maintain code quality throughout the development process.
